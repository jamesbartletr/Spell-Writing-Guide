## File Breakdown

### bard_spells.py
_Generated by AI_

`bard_spells.py` appears to be a utility script for generating musical notes (frequencies) based on various attributes like range, level, area type, damage type, and school. The underlying idea seems to assign musical characteristics (chords or notes) to these attributes, perhaps as a way to represent them in a creative, audible context, which could be related to something like spells in a role-playing game or another creative project.

### bases.py
_Generated by AI_

`bases.py` contains a collection of functions designed to generate and manipulate geometric and mathematical bases in the form of x, y coordinates. These functions can be used to define various base shapes and patterns, such as polygons, lines, circles, and curves. The script is designed to serve as a utility for applications requiring base patterns for visualization, mathematical modeling, or graphical entities.

#### Key Features:
- **Polygon Generator**: Create x, y coordinates for an n-sided polygon with customizable radius and starting angle.
- **Line Generator**: Generate a straight horizontal line with n points.
- **Quadratic Function**: Calculate points using a quadratic mathematical function.
- **Circle Generator**: Creates x, y coordinates of a circular section between specified angles.
- **Cubic Function**: Generates points following a cubic polynomial curve.
- **Golden Spiral**: Create coordinate data following the golden ratio spiral for n points.


### line_shapes.py
_Generated by AI_

The `line_shapes.py` script provides a set of utility functions for generating geometric shapes and curves (circles, arcs, and lines) between two points in a Cartesian coordinate system. These functions are useful in applications like visualization, geometric modeling, and data plotting that involve connecting points with customizable shapes.

#### Key Features:
- **`centre_circle(P, Q, thetas)`**: Draws a connecting circle between two points `(P, Q)` where the center is the arithmetic mean of the two points. Supports parameterized arcs or full circles.
- **`non_centre_circle(P, Q, b, thetas)`**: Draws a connecting circle between two points with a center offset `b` from the average of the points. Always selects the smaller arc.
- **`straight(P, Q)`**: Generates points for a straight line connecting two specified points.

The functions integrate numpy for numerical computation and provide flexibility in selecting full circles, arcs, or specific shape parameters. The script is modular and can easily be incorporated into graphical or mathematical computation projects.


### writer.py
_Generated by AI_

The `writer.py` file is a Python script designed for generating customizable visual representations of spells using a variety of attributes. The script integrates graphical plotting using `matplotlib`, custom shape generation, and attribute loading to generate unique diagrams that represent spell properties such as level, range, damage type, school, area, and more.

#### Key Features

Key features:
- **Binary Pattern Generation**: Produces unique binary combinations for encoding different properties of a spell which are then visualized.
- **Spell Representation**: Plots spell attributes (e.g., level, range, school, etc.) visually with advanced customization options, including legends, titles, colors, and planarity.
- **Custom Visualization**: Custom base shapes and line styles can be provided via external modules, enabling flexible visual styling.
- **Command-line Usage**: Supports execution from the command line for on-demand generation of visuals by specifying spell attributes.
- **Data-driven**: Reads spell attribute data from text files, which makes it easy to extend or modify properties.

The visualization serves Dungeons & Dragons players, Game Masters, or enthusiasts wanting visually distinct representations of spells for adding flavor or understanding mechanics.


### writer_live.py
_Generated by AI_
The `writer_live.py` script is an interactive data visualization tool built using Bokeh, a Python library for creating web-based visualizations. The application is designed to display a geometric visualization based on user-configurable attributes selected through dropdown menus. These dropdown options are dynamically loaded from external files to enhance customizability. The current feature set focuses on providing users with options to select ranges, levels, area types, damage types, and schools, which subsequently affect the plotted figure.


#### Key Features:
1. **Interactive Dropdowns**:
    - Dynamically populated dropdown menus allow users to explore and configure various attributes.

2. **Customizable Plot Parameters**:
    - A scatter plot with customizable x and y coordinates, related to the selected attributes.

3. **Dynamic Geometry**:
    - Uses a base geometric function (`bases.polygon`) to compute initial scatter plot coordinates.

4. **Bokeh Integration**:
    - Utilizes the Bokeh `figure` for a visually interactive display and integrates user-driven events (e.g., dropdown selections and button clicks).

5. **Event Handling**:
    - Button and dropdowns trigger custom JavaScript code or Python callbacks.
