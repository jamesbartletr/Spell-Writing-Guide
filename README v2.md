## File Breakdown

### bard_spells.py
_Generated by AI_

This file appears to be a utility script for generating musical notes (frequencies) based on various attributes like range, level, area type, damage type, and school. The underlying idea seems to assign musical characteristics (chords or notes) to these attributes, perhaps as a way to represent them in a creative, audible context, which could be related to something like spells in a role-playing game or another creative project.
