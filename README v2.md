## File Breakdown

### bard_spells.py
_Generated by AI_

`bard_spells.py` appears to be a utility script for generating musical notes (frequencies) based on various attributes like range, level, area type, damage type, and school. The underlying idea seems to assign musical characteristics (chords or notes) to these attributes, perhaps as a way to represent them in a creative, audible context, which could be related to something like spells in a role-playing game or another creative project.

### bases.py
_Generated by AI_

`bases.py` contains a collection of functions designed to generate and manipulate geometric and mathematical bases in the form of x, y coordinates. These functions can be used to define various base shapes and patterns, such as polygons, lines, circles, and curves. The script is designed to serve as a utility for applications requiring base patterns for visualization, mathematical modeling, or graphical entities.

#### Key Features:
- **Polygon Generator**: Create x, y coordinates for an n-sided polygon with customizable radius and starting angle.
- **Line Generator**: Generate a straight horizontal line with n points.
- **Quadratic Function**: Calculate points using a quadratic mathematical function.
- **Circle Generator**: Creates x, y coordinates of a circular section between specified angles.
- **Cubic Function**: Generates points following a cubic polynomial curve.
- **Golden Spiral**: Create coordinate data following the golden ratio spiral for n points.


### line_shapes.py
_Generated by AI_

The `line_shapes.py` script provides a set of utility functions for generating geometric shapes and curves (circles, arcs, and lines) between two points in a Cartesian coordinate system. These functions are useful in applications like visualization, geometric modeling, and data plotting that involve connecting points with customizable shapes.

#### Key Features:
- **`centre_circle(P, Q, thetas)`**: Draws a connecting circle between two points `(P, Q)` where the center is the arithmetic mean of the two points. Supports parameterized arcs or full circles.
- **`non_centre_circle(P, Q, b, thetas)`**: Draws a connecting circle between two points with a center offset `b` from the average of the points. Always selects the smaller arc.
- **`straight(P, Q)`**: Generates points for a straight line connecting two specified points.

The functions integrate numpy for numerical computation and provide flexibility in selecting full circles, arcs, or specific shape parameters. The script is modular and can easily be incorporated into graphical or mathematical computation projects.
